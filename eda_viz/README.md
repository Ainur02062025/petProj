## PetProj 1: Pandas profiling & Sweetviz and Variance Inflation Factor

---

A pet project that is centered on building of regression model for prediction of median value of houses. It serves as a refresher for EDA and building of regression models (Linear regression, regularized regression) while taking the opportunity to also explore new Python eda libraries. It is structured into multiple parts, to facilitate time management for self-experimentation, reporting of findings, self-learning and other commitments. Salient points are outlined below.

**Summary:** 

> **Part 1:** In this project space, the basic features of **Pandas profiling & Sweetviz** are explored. Using the Boston Housing dataset from scikit-learn, EDA is done through pandas functions, followed by pandas profiling  and sweetviz. This section ends off with personal insights and findings on the incorporation of these libraries to facilitate one's expected eda processes for any data science project.
>
> **Part 2:**  Typical Linear Regression model building, where more research into applications of various statistical approaches for correlation matrix is done. The is followed by the discussion on **Variance Inflation Factor**, and how it can be used in conjunction with the correlation matrix to mitigate multi-collinearity.
