## Part 1: EDA Libraries - Pandas profiling & Sweetviz

---

A pet project that is structured into multiple parts, to facilitate time management for self-experimentation, reporting of findings, self-learning and other commitments. 

**Summary:** 

> **Part 1:** In this project space, the basic features of **Pandas profiling & Sweetviz** are explored. Using the Boston Housing dataset from scikit-learn, EDA is done through pandas functions, followed by pandas profiling  and sweetviz. This section ends off with personal insights and findings on the incorporation of these libraries to facilitate one's expected eda processes for any data science project.
